# OGA_PMTE
OGA_PMTE is modified Odroid Go Advence for testing circuit or resiving and analyzing radio signal
PMTE stands for Portable Multipurpose Test Equipment
In this project i want to make Odroid Go Advence(OGA) to work as Multimeter/SDR/Wire communication tester

# HOW TO
To achieve my goal, i need to attach some addithonal device like esp8266,RTL-SDR and make it work on OGA
So modifing addithonal device to make it easy to attach and release to OGA and making addithonal device to work on OGA will be added to this project

# MY PLAN
first i will make OGA as Serial,UART,I2C,SPI monitor by using python
UI will be made by python curses module cuase i don't know how to make GUI. XD
